            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, thanks for stoping by!  I am currently a Sr. Solutions Analyst at POSSIBLE in Cincinnati, OH but I am always interested in hearing about new opportunities to do exciting digital work.  I am passionate about creating highly-interactive web experiences with the newest technology.  Please check out my resume and digital portfolio while you are here!</p>

    <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p>My passion is for delivering highly-interactive mobile and desktop websites. In the past 7 years of my digital experience, I have developed and worked with teams to launch sites on a variety of platforms (Drupal 8, Wordpress, Java, .NET) while leveraging a variety of development tools including VM's, Grunt, Gulp, Sass, Git, Subversion, Handlebars, jQuery, Jira, Exact Target and more.</p>

            <p>In my role at POSSIBLE, on of the largest digital agencies in the U.S., I provide technical solutions to our creative teams, gather requirements, and lead development efforts on projects. Projects I launched included:</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>ReadySetEat.com
        <li>ConagraBrands.com
        <li>ConagraNutrition.com
<li>DaisyBrand.com
<li>WickedKitchen.com
<li>CurateSnacks.com
<li>and many other Conagra brand site updates.
</ul>
</p>
<p>While an E-Commerce administrator in marketing at a large, publicly-held company, I have lead and successfully championed the adoption of new technologies including wordpress (web cms software), yammer (collaboration software), highcharts (javascript charting software), and web-based marketing tools to make The Andersons, Inc. more agile, more aggressive, and cost effective in our web strategy. In my marketing role, I've shot and produced over 1 thousand web videos, and manage a host of social media and analytics for The Andersons, Inc.</p>

<p>Professionally, I hope to continue to refine my development skills and put them to work managing and/or developing large-scale projects.
